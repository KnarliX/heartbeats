## How to Host on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload all the files to the repository
3. Go to Settings > Pages
4. Select the main branch as the source
5. Click on Save
6. Your site will be published at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

## Repository Guidelines

1. **Keep branch structure simple**: 
   - Use `main` branch for the production-ready code
   - Create `dev` branch for development work

2. **Folder organization**:
   - Keep all assets (images, audio files) in the root directory
   - Group related files together (HTML, CSS, JS)

3. **Commit messages**:
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Format: `[type]: Brief description` 
   - Examples: `[feature]: Add heart animation`, `[fix]: Resolve audio playback issue`

4. **Version control**:
   - Tag releases with version numbers (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)
   - Update the version in manifest.json when making significant changes

5. **Audio files**:
   - Only add audio files sung by Janvi
   - Keep file sizes optimized for web (compress if needed)

6. **Testing**:
   - Test on both mobile and desktop before committing
   - Verify background playback works correctly

## Customization

You can easily customize the player by:

1. Changing the color scheme in style.css (look for #9c27b0 and other purple colors)
2. Updating the logo by changing the URL in index.html and manifest.json
3. Adding or removing songs in the main.js file
